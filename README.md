## 1 Vision and Goals Of this Project
This was one of my class project when I was attending BU. But honestly, we did not completely finish it because of the time limitation. And 2 years later, it suddenly came to my mind. It would be nice to use more popular tool and use more systematic method to analyze these interesting data set. Also as a foodie also a software Engineer, I am always a huge fan of Yelp. So for this semi-new project, I would like continue to analyze the open source yelp dataset a bit, trying to find some more interesting restaurant/backery tendency to richen my cold knowledge about food. I plan to use popular data tools, such as numpy, Spark, MongoDB to process the data set. It would be mainly focusing on:
* Basic data clustering and visualization with Pyplot and Numpy on Business part data
* Apply demension reduction algorithm on review part of data to extract main option of each restaurant
* Analyze the data in Spark using PySpark and SparkSQL set on AWS
* Using machine learning method to make a prodiction for opening restaurant

## 2 Important tools and Concept
